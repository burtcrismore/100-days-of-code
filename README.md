# 100-days-of-code

The 100 Days of Code Challenge

<h1>Daily Log</h1>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> GitHub is set up so I can commit my code. I have my HTML ready and I'm working on the JS logic for the lovable To-Do list as my first project.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on dynamically creating elements and appending them to the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> I worked on event listeners for the To-Do list. Clicking or pressing the return key will add a task.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 4</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> So far most of my JS challenges come from, "you don't know what you don't know." I didn't know I could execute a click on keydown. There are so many more examples, but the point is, JS requires discovery.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 5</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I spent some time styling my To-Do list app. I also need to figure out how to run my "for of" loop each time a new element is appended to the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 6</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a troubleshooting kind of day. I was able to figure out that running a click event on an "svg" is problematic.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 7</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on refactoring some code. Nothing too mind blowing, but I'm coding.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 8</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on error handling with conditional statements. If the user doesn't fill out the field, show a message.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 9</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Does it count as coding if all you did was troubleshoot and run into issues? Hopefully tomorrow will be better.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 10</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I learned that event delegation works well for dynamically created elements.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 11</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a really productive day. I refactored code to simplify my logic, worked with the Date object, and used a random number to pull in different items from an array.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 12</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a light day of coding, but I did get in some style updates to my project.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 13</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on some finishing touches for my To-Do List project. I’m almost done.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 14</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> I’ve learned a lot over the course of two weeks, and feel good about it, but I just don’t understand how to get Font Awesome SVG icons to swap using event delegation. Of all the things to get stuck on.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 15</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I continued troubleshooting my code. I also worked on randomization for another project.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 16</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked with "Math.floor and Math.random." I think I have a few game projects in my future.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 17</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked with JavaScript classes and used objects in a way that reduces code duplication.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 18</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on some JS design patterns and ways to keep my code DRY.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 19</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on conditional statements and controlling flow. Does anyone still use switch statements in JS. I get this feeling more people are using object literals.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 20</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I’m looping over object properties and dynamically creating tables.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 21</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> I kept it simple today. I worked on some UI dev and created a toggle button. There are times when you just want to click on something repeatedly and watch it animate. My brain needed the rest.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 22</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked with JS event listeners and the CSS transition property. The goal was to control animations based on event timing.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 23</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked with JS DOM traversal and event handlers. I’m almost done with my first project.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 24</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> To Do List done! Includes date, total task count, random quotes when zero tasks, error message when adding no task, task complete and delete task.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 25</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I started the task of redesigning and developing my portfolio site. I spent some time looking into Gatsby JS. Anyone use Gatsby?</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 26</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a short day of coding. I worked a little bit on conditionals and form field feedback.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 27</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on coding a nav bar in preparation for a sticky JS scroll-to nav.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 28</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked with JS scrollTo and event listeners.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 29</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on some JS design patterns. What are some of your go to patterns?</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 30</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Wow, 30 days so far. Today I worked on my Rock, Paper, Scissor game.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 31</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was mainly CSS as I styled my Rock, Paper, Scissor game. And of course a little bit of JS.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 32</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked with CSS animations and event listers that wait until the animations end..</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 33</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on using an object to store shared logic. My goal is to update my code so it’s more organized and not repetitive.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 34</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on JavaScript promises. It’s by far the most confusing concept so far.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 35</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on JavaScript callbacks. It’s moments like these where I really have stop myself and take the time to learn basic concepts before moving on.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 36</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> I had a talk with JavaScript today and they said take a break, so I brushed up on some Sass instead.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 37</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I jumped back into JS promises and async/await. Surprisingly, it is starting to make more sense.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 38</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Well, I thought I was getting somewhere with JS promises. I understand the concept, but it’s unclear how to pass the resolve() values correctly. I’m attempting to chain a series of loops and conditions.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 39</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I realized that I might be using the wrong “coding tool” for the job. One of the challenges of teaching yourself is that you have no one to tell you you’re doing it wrong. I think it was learning moment.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 40</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on chaining object methods and the relationship of {this} and the object.</p>
