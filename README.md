# 100-days-of-code

The 100 Days of Code Challenge

<h1>Daily Log</h1>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> GitHub is set up so I can commit my code. I have my HTML ready and I'm working on the JS logic for the lovable To-Do list as my first project.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on dynamically creating elements and appending them to the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> I worked on event listeners for the To-Do list. Clicking or pressing the return key will add a task.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 4</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> So far most of my JS challenges come from, "you don't know what you don't know." I didn't know I could execute a click on keydown. There are so many more examples, but the point is, JS requires discovery.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 5</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I spent some time styling my To-Do list app. I also need to figure out how to run my "for of" loop each time a new element is appended to the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 6</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a troubleshooting kind of day. I was able to figure out that running a click event on an "svg" is problematic.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 7</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on refactoring some code. Nothing too mind blowing, but I'm coding.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 8</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on error handling with conditional statements. If the user doesn't fill out the field, show a message.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 9</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Does it count as coding if all you did was troubleshoot and run into issues? Hopefully tomorrow will be better.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 10</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I learned that event delegation works well for dynamically created elements.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 11</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a really productive day. I refactored code to simplify my logic, worked with the Date object, and used a random number to pull in different items from an array.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 12</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a light day of coding, but I did get in some style updates to my project.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 13</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on some finishing touches for my To-Do List project. I’m almost done.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 14</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> I’ve learned a lot over the course of two weeks, and feel good about it, but I just don’t understand how to get Font Awesome SVG icons to swap using event delegation. Of all the things to get stuck on.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 15</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I continued troubleshooting my code. I also worked on randomization for another project.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 16</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked with "Math.floor and Math.random." I think I have a few game projects in my future.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 17</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked with JavaScript classes and used objects in a way that reduces code duplication.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 18</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on some JS design patterns and ways to keep my code DRY.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 19</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on conditional statements and controlling flow. Does anyone still use switch statements in JS. I get this feeling more people are using object literals.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 20</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I’m looping over object properties and dynamically creating tables.</p>
<hr>
