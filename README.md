The 100 Days of Code Challenge

<h1>Daily Log</h1>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> GitHub is set up so I can commit my code. I have my HTML ready and I'm working on the JS logic for the lovable To-Do list as my first project.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on dynamically creating elements and appending them to the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> I worked on event listeners for the To-Do list. Clicking or pressing the return key will add a task.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 4</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> So far most of my JS challenges come from, "you don't know what you don't know." I didn't know I could execute a click on keydown. There are so many more examples, but the point is, JS requires discovery.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 5</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I spent some time styling my To-Do list app. I also need to figure out how to run my "for of" loop each time a new element is appended to the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 6</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a troubleshooting kind of day. I was able to figure out that running a click event on an "svg" is problematic.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 7</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on refactoring some code. Nothing too mind blowing, but I'm coding.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 8</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I worked on error handling with conditional statements. If the user doesn't fill out the field, show a message.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 9</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Does it count as coding if all you did was troubleshoot and run into issues? Hopefully tomorrow will be better.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 10</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today I learned that event delegation works well for dynamically created elements.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Day 11</h3>
<p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> Today was a really productive day. I refactored code to simplify my logic, worked with the Date object, and used a random number to pull in different items from an array.</p>
